    "1. **Define Python Functions**: Write actual functions that do the work\n",
    "2. **Create Function Schemas**: Tell OpenAI what functions exist and their parameters\n",
    "3. **Make API Call**: Include `tools` parameter with function definitions\n",
    "4. **Check Response**: See if model wants to call functions (`tool_calls`)\n",

    "- The model decides when to call functions based on user input\n",
    "- You execute the actual Python code, not OpenAI\n",
    "- Function results are sent back to continue the conversation\n",
    "- Multiple functions can be called in a single request"
